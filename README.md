# ChiOS

Simple kernel project using modern C++ and strong typing and an extremely barebones libc implementation.

It requires gcc to be recompiled with cross-compilation support and then using [this script](https://gist.github.com/schiozzone/baae80851f1965ba9b968c49b67046fd) to compile the project for generic `i686-elf` targets.
